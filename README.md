# bookbot
BookBot is my first project! This small program does basic text analysis and is quite customizable.
- It will read any text file of which you provide it a path for.
- It will give formatted word/character counts of the text.
- It will generate a little report of counts for you.
- You can tinker with the functions to count tokens, words, letters, numbers, etc. as you see fit!

  I am very proud of this project.  This is my first real achievement as a programmer. No course or tutorial; just an idea (and burning desire to start down the path to becoming an ML Engineer!)
